## About Lauren

I am a senior at Oregon State University. I am currently in the process of obtaining my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. My applied option is in Human Computer Interaction, where I focus on making the user experience as pleasing and effective for the user as possible. 

This field has allowed me to explore different areas of computer science, from back-end database work to more artistic front-end work. I value all aspects of computer science because it is necessary for everything to work together to create a positive experience for the user. 

Once I obtain my BS degree in Computer Science, I hope to use what I have learned to make a difference in this field. I am excited to work in the industry and to be a part of a team working towards a bigger goal in technology.
