**Description** 
As a team of four, I have been collaborating with my peers to create an online membership and class registration website for the Craft Center at Oregon State University. As of right now, the Craft Center completes all of their transactions through a paper-only system. Through the development of this project, my team and I have made an effective registration tool that allows students at OSU to register for membership and classes, and allows the employees of the Craft Center to manage membership through our administrative portal.  

**Languages and Technology**
- ASP.NET Core
- C# (for back-end)
- HTML and CSS (for front-end)
- MS SQL Database 
- SAML 2.0
- Entity Framework Core

**What I Gained From This Project**
Even though I have only recently started this project, I have gained a lot of great experience and knowledge from my work so far. I have learned the importance of communication with my project partner and stakeholders. I have also gained the skill of explaining technical goals to non-technical individuals, as this project is for creative artists of the Craft Center. This project requires me to work with technology that I am not as familiar with, which has helped get me out of my comfort zone and learn new languages that can help with my future career. 

**Personal Contributions To This Project**
During development of this project, I was responsible for handling membership registration for future students. I had to create a form that students could fill out with all off their information so that it would be saved to their personal profile page. With this membership form, all of the user's information is read into the database, thus creating a new user. I ensured that any one user could only be created once, through the use of unique identifiers that were assigned to each account. The membership form requires that each user agrees to all of the Craft Center policies before they are allowed to move forward and become a member. 

I also assisted in the administrative side of our website, where I helped allow the admins of the Craft Center to be able to update or delete any existing members within the database. With my knowledge of human computer interaction, I made sure that the admin interface was simple and easy to understand for the Craft Center employees and students that will use our website. I did this through effective styling, as well as requiring minimal steps that need to be taken by the user.

### Kernel Movie Review Website

**Date**
Spring 2020

**Repo**
[Repository for this project](https://github.com/laurengalle/Movie-Website)

**Description** 
For this project, my team and I created a movie review website, Kernel. We used the different CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to create a functional website for the user to add and delete different movie reviews to the website. Any additions, deleteions, or updates were linked to the database for this project. I also focused heavily on the user interface for this project, where I was able to create and effective and please experience for the user.  

**Languages and Technology**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MySQL

**What I Gained From This Project**
The main aspect I gained from this project was having to work with a database. I had to create a database from scratch and understand how to connect it to the website with all of the proper operations. I was also able to strengthen my front-end visual skills with CSS.

### Traveling Salesman Algorithm 

**Date**
Winter 2020

**Description** 
This project involved trying to find the fastest alogorithm for the Traveling Salesman problem. My group and I used the Christofides algorithm to solve this probem. The implementation uses Prim’s algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree. This is followed by finding a perfect matching among vertices with odd degree. Then edges of the matching and the MST are combined into a multigraph. An Euler cycle is found in the multigraph by skipping over vertices that have already been visited. The Euler cycle is then put into the form of a Hamiltonian path.

**Languages and Technology**
- Python
- C++

**What I Gained From This Project**
This project was useful for me to better understand the different computer algorithms and how they can be ustilized for the fastest solution to an every day probem like the Traveling Salesman problem. I researched various different algorithms and worked with a team to help determine which one was the fastest and most effective.

### Phi Sigma Rho Recruitment Website 

**Date**
Spring 2019

**Description** 
This project was my first website development project. With a team, I helped develop a website for my sorority, Phi Sigma Rho. We provided the user with all of the different recruitment events through a working, clickable calendar. We also allowed the user to apply to the sorority and to see the different members of the sorority to understand more about who we were as an organization.

**Languages and Technology**
- Handlebars
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Mongo DB

**What I Gained From This Project**
I gained a lot of front-end skills from this project. This was the project that sparked my interest in front-end work and designing for the user, as a whole. I was able to tap into my creativity to create an aesthetic and effective design for the user.
